# What is Azure Policy?

Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. Through
its compliance dashboard, it provides an aggregated view to evaluate the overall state of the
environment, with the ability to drill down to the per-resource, per-policy granularity. It also
helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and
automatic remediation for new resources.

Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency,
regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. Policy definitions for these common use cases
are already available in your Azure environment as built-ins to help you get started.

All Azure Policy data and objects are encrypted at rest. For more information, see
