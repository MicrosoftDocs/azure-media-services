title: Azure Media Services v2 (legacy) documentation
summary: IMPORTANT Update your Azure Media Services REST API and SDKs to v3 by 29 February 2024.** Version 3 of Azure Media Services REST API and client SDKs for .NET and Java offers more capabilities than version 2. We are retiring version 2 of the Azure Media Services REST API and client SDKs for .NET and Java. **Action Required** To minimize disruption to your workloads, review the [migration guide](/azure/media-services/latest/migrate-v-2-v-3-migration-introduction) to transition your code from the version 2 API and SDKs to version 3 API and SDK before February 29th, 2024. After February 29th, 2024, Azure Media Services will *no longer accept traffic on the version 2 REST API, the ARM account management API version 2015-10-01, or from the version 2 .NET client SDKs. This includes any 3rd party open-source client SDKS that may call the version 2 API.* Learn about the latest version, starting with the [Media Services v3 Overview](/azure/media-services/latest/media-services-overview).
