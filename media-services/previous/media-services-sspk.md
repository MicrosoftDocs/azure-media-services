# Licensing Microsoft&reg; Smooth Streaming Client Porting Kit

[!INCLUDE [media services api v2 logo](./includes/v2-hr.md)]
 
## Overview
Microsoft Smooth Streaming Client Porting Kit (**SSPK** for short) is a Smooth Streaming client implementation that is optimized to help embedded device manufacturers, cable and mobile operators, content service providers, handset manufacturers, independent software vendors (ISVs), and solution providers to create products and services for streaming adaptive content in Smooth Streaming format. SSPK is a device and platform-independent implementation of Smooth Streaming client that can be ported by the licensee to any device and platform. 

Included below is a high-level architecture and IIS Smooth Streaming Porting Kit box is the Smooth Streaming Client implementation provided by Microsoft and includes all the core logic for playback of Smooth Streaming content. This content is then ported by partners for a specific device or platform by implementing appropriate interfaces.
