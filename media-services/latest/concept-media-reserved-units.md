# Media Reserved Units

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

Media Reserved Units (MRUs) were previously used in Azure Media Services v2 to control encoding concurrency and performance. You no longer need to manage MRUs or request quota increases for any media services account as the system will automatically scale up and down based on load. You'll also see performance that is equal to or improved in comparison to using MRUs. 

If you have an account that was created using a version prior to the 2020-05-01 API, you'll still have access to APIs for managing MRUs, however none of the MRU configuration that you set will be used to control encoding concurrency or performance. If you donâ€™t see the option to manage MRUs in the Azure portal, you have an account that was created with the 2020-05-01 API or later. 

## Billing

While there were previously charges for Media Reserved Units, as of April 17, 2021 there are no longer any charges for accounts that have configuration for Media Reserved Units. For more information on billing for encoding jobs, see [Encoding video and audio with Media Services](encoding-concept.md)

For accounts created in with the **2020-05-01** version of the API, that is, the v3 version, or through the Azure portal, scaling and media reserved units are no longer required. Scaling is now automatically handled by the service internally. Media reserved units are no longer needed or supported for any Azure Media Services account. See [Media reserved units (legacy)](concept-media-reserved-units.md) for additional information.
