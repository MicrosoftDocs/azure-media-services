# Media Services regulatory compliance

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

Media Services meets the demanding requirements of the US Federal Risk & Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) and of the US Department of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide (SRG) Impact Level (IL) 2, IL4, and IL5. By deploying authorized services in Azure Government, Office 365 GCC High and DoD, and Dynamics 365 US Government, federal and defense agencies can use a rich array of cloud services while meeting their compliance obligations.

## FedRAMP and DoD compliance

Media Services in Azure Public maintains:

- FedRAMP High Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO)
- DoD IL2 Provisional Authorization (PA)

Media Services in Azure Government maintains:

- FedRAMP High P-ATO
- DoD IL2 PA
- DoD IL4 PA
- DoD IL5 PA

For more information about Azure compliance coverage for US government, see Azure [FedRAMP High](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-fedramp), [DoD IL2](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il2), [DoD IL4](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il4), and [DoD IL5](/azure/compliance/offerings/offering-dod-il5) documentation. For FedRAMP and DoD audit scope, see [Cloud services by audit scope](../../azure-government/compliance/azure-services-in-fedramp-auditscope.md).

## Azure compliance documentation

To help you meet your own compliance obligations across regulated industries and markets worldwide, Azure maintains the largest compliance portfolio in the industry both in terms of breadth (total number of [compliance offerings](/azure/compliance/offerings/)) and depth (number of [customer-facing services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/) in assessment scope). For service availability, see [Products available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/global-infrastructure/services/).

Azure compliance offerings are grouped into four segments - globally applicable, US Government, industry specific, and region/country specific.  Compliance offerings are based on various types of assurances, including formal certifications, attestations, validations, authorizations, and assessments produced by independent third-party auditing firms, as well as contractual amendments, self-assessments, and customer guidance documents produced by Microsoft. For more information, see [Azure compliance documentation](../../compliance/index.yml). You will also find additional compliance resources such as audit reports, a checklist for privacy and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), compliance blueprints, country and regional guidelines, implementation and mappings, as well as white papers and analyst reports.
