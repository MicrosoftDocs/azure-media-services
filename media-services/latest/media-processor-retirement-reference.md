| Video Optical Character Recognition | June 1, 2020 | Retired | This media processor was replaced by Azure Video Indexer. Also, consider using [Azure Media Services v3 API](../latest/analyze-video-audio-files-concept.md). <br/>See [Compare Azure Media Services v3 presets and Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-for-media-docs/compare-video-indexer-with-media-services-presets). |

| Content Moderator | June 1, 2020 | Retired | This media processor was replaced by Azure Video Indexer. Also, consider using [Azure Media Services v3 API](analyze-video-audio-files-concept.md). <br/>See [Compare Azure Media Services v3 presets and Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-analyzer/video-analyzer-for-media-docs/compare-video-indexer-with-media-services-presets). |
| Azure Media Indexer | March 1, 2023 | Retired | This media processor is replaced by the [Media Services v3 AudioAnalyzerPreset Basic mode](analyze-video-audio-files-concept.md). For more information, see [Migrate from Azure Media Indexer 2 to Azure Video Indexer](../previous/migrate-indexer-v1-v2.md) (formerly Video Indexer). |
| Video Analyzer preset (in v3 API) | Sept 14, 2023 | Planned |  As Microsoftâ€™s [Responsible AI Standards](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/) outlines, Microsoft is committed to fairness, privacy, security, and transparency with respect to AI systems. To align with these standards, **Azure Media Services is retiring the [Video Analyzer preset](./analyze-video-audio-files-concept.md) on September 14, 2023**. This preset currently allows you to extract multiple video and audio insights from a video file. Customers can replace their current workflows using the more advanced feature set offered by [Azure Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/concepts-overview)
|
| Media Encoder Premium Workflow | February 29, 2024 | Planned | The AMS v2 API no longer supports the Premium Encoder. If you previously used the workflow-based Premium Encoder for HEVC encoding, you should migrate to the [new v3 Standard Encoder](encode-media-encoder-standard-formats-reference.md) with HEVC encoding support. <br/> If you require advanced workflow features of the Premium Encoder, you're encouraged to start using an Azure advanced encoding partner from [Imagine Communications](https://imaginecommunications.com/), [Telestream](https://telestream.net), or [Bitmovin](https://bitmovin.com). |
