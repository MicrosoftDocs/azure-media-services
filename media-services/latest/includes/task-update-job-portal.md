### Update a job in the portal

The only thing that you would update for a job in the portal is its priority. To change the priority of a job:

1. Navigate to the Media Services account you want to work with.
1. Select **Transforms + jobs** from the menu. The Transforms + jobs screen will appear.
1. Select the transform that is associated with the job you want to see. The transform properties screen will appear with a listing of the jobs using the transform.
1. Select **Change priority**.  The priority downdown will appear.
1. Select the priority you want for the job.
