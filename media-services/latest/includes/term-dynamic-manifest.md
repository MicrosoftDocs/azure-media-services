**Dynamic manifest** - As part of dynamic packaging, the streaming client manifests such as HLS Master Playlist, DASH Media Presentation Description (MPD), and Smooth Streaming, are dynamically generated based on the format selector in the URL. The manifests can also be adjusted with Asset level or Global filters to remove specific tracks and provide more targeted manifests to viewers.
