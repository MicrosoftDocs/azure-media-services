title: Transcoding
---

**Transcoding** - Decoding a video or audio stream stored in one codec and then re-encoding using the same codec with different settings, or using another codec. Most file and live encoding in Azure Media Services is really technically “transcoding” rather than “encoding, but we refer to most all codec related operations as “encoding”.
