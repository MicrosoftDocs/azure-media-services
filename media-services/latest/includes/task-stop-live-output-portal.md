### Stop a live output in the portal

If you stop a live output in the portal, it will be stopped and the *output* will be deleted. The *asset* will still be available for use, with valid streaming URLs, for on-demand streaming.

If you aren't already at the live event screen:

1. Navigate to the Media Services account you want to work with.
1. Select **Live streaming** from the menu.
1. Select the live event you want to work with.

At the live event screen:

1. Select **Stop output** next to the output in the list of outputs. A warning prompt will appear.
1. Select **Stop** to stop the output. The output asset is still available for on-demand streaming.
