**Streaming** - Streaming is best understood in comparison of downloading content.  When content is downloaded, the entire file is delivered to the end user and the file is saved locally.  With streaming, however, chunks of media content are continuously delivered to a client player in data packets.  The content does not persist on the user's computer.
