### Problem

When creating a new Media Services account, the error “LocationNotAvailableForResourceType” appears.

### Cause

Not all Media Services features are available in all regions.

### Solution

View [Azure Media Services v3 clouds and regions availability](../azure-clouds-regions.md) to see what features are available in regions around the world.
