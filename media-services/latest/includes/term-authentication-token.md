## Authentication token

Access tokens enable clients to securely call protected web APIs, and are used by web APIs to perform authentication and authorization. Per the OAuth specification, access tokens are opaque strings without a set format - some identity providers (IDPs) use GUIDs, others use encrypted blobs. For more information about tokens, see [Microsoft identity platform access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens).
