title: Streaming endpoint
---

**Streaming endpoint** - A streaming endpoint is a dynamic (just-in-time) packaging and origin service that delivers live and on-demand content directly to a client player app, using one of the common streaming media protocols (HLS or DASH). It also provides dynamic (just-in-time) encryption to DRMs.
