**Thumbnail sprite** - A JPEG file that contains multiple small resolution thumbnails stitched together into a single (large) image in columns and rows, together with a VTT file that defines the CSS offsets and resolutions for each frame to be extracted or displayed in an HTML5 web page.  Commonly used for zoetrope of film-strip controls in a streaming video player to enhance fast forward and rewind experiences.
