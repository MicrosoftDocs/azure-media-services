title: Encrypted content won't play in offline mode.

## Encrypted content won't play in offline mode.

| Cause | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| The player that you are using to play the downloaded AES encrypted videos in offline mode on iOS devices handles how those videos play. The cause isn't with Media Services. | Review the documentation for your chosen offline video player. |
