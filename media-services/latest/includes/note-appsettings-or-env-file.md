Open appsettings.json in your downloaded project. Replace the values with credentials that you got from [accessing APIs](../access-api-howto.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the *.env* file format at the root of the project to set your environment variables only once for all projects in the .NET samples repository. Just copy the *sample.env* file, and then fill out the information that you got from the Media Services **API Access** page in the Azure portal or from the Azure CLI. Rename the *sample.env* file to just *.env* to use it across all projects.<br/><br/>
> The *.gitignore* file is already configured to prevent publishing this file into your forked repository.
