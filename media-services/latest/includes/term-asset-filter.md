title: Asset filter
---

**Asset filter** - Applies a dynamic manifest filter to remove or restrict video or audio tracks from the HLS or DASH manifest. Filters can select tracks by bitrate, codecs, resolutions, languages, time range and more. A filter can be applied to an asset with which the filter was associated upon creation, and lasts for the lifetime of the asset.
