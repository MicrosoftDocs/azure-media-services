## On-premises encoder isn't sending data to the live event.

| Cause | Solution |
| ----- | -------- |
| You may be using an encoder that hasn't been tested with Media Services. | Please see [Verified on-premises live streaming encoders](../encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md?amspage=troubleshooting).|
| The on-premises encoder may not be configured correctly.| Confirm that you have correctly [configured the on-premises encoder](../encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md?amspage=troubleshooting#configuring-on-premises-live-encoder-settings). |
