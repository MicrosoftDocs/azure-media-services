## On-premises encoder isn't sending data to the live event.

### Cause

1. You may be using an encoder that hasn't been tested with Media Services.
1. The on-premises encoder may not be configured correctly.

### Solution

1. Please see [Verified on-premises live streaming encoders](../encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md).
1. Confirm that you have correctly [configured the on-premises encoder](../encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md#configuring-on-premises-live-encoder-settings).
