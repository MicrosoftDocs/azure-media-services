## Captions vs subtitles

In general, *captions* are text tracks that are used for closed captioning that enables viewers who need accessibility features in a video player to understand what is being said and the sounds that exist in a video. *Subtitles*, are text tracks that show the speech and sounds in a different language than the source language.

For example, if the source language of a video is English, then the text track would be considered a *caption*. If an additional language text track is provided, it's considered a *subtitle*. You can use one text track for both a caption and subtitles, but implementation varies between video player clients.
