**Latency** - The time it takes for media content to be transmitted from the origin server to the player client. It can also refer to the â€œglass-to-glass" latency which measures the time that it takes for a frame of video to travel from the camera (glass #1,) through the encoder, over the wire to the cloud service for processing, and out through the delivery network or CDN to the client player or device (glass #2 would be the monitor or device screen.)
