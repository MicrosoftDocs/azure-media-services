### Problem

On-premises encoder is not sending data to the live event.

### Cause

You may be using an encoder that has not been tested with Media Services.

### Solution

Please see [Verified on-premises live streaming encoders](encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md) and the especially [configuration settings](encode-recommended-on-premises-live-encoders.md#configuring-on-premises-live-encoder-settings).
