**Manifest** - A text file that lists the files of an adaptive bitrate streaming package. Adaptive streaming protocols like HLS, DASH, and Smooth Streaming rely on a manifest file to describe the available tracks of video, audio and text content available to the player. Manifests can also contain “renditions” that describe the various encoding of the same content to give the client player a choice.
