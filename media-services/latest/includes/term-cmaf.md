title: Common Media Application Format (CMAF)
---

**Common Media Application Format (CMAF)** - A video packaging standard established by the Moving Pictures Expert Group (MPEG) to reduce the complexity of publishing video media. This format uses the fragmented MP4 container to store and deliver small chunks of audio, video, and text when paired with an HLS or DASH manifest.  In addition, the specification provides details on how content should be encrypted, and how to package closed captions, subtitles, and other advanced features to achieve compatibility between the HLS and DASH streaming ecosystem players.
