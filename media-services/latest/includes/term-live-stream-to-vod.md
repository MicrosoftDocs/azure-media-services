title: Live stream to VOD
---

**Live stream to video on-demand (VOD)** - When live video and audio is transmitted by an on-premises encoder to Media Services, the encoded content is streamed from a live output.  When the live event is stopped, the live output is deleted, but the encoded files are kept in an asset so viewers can watch the content later (on-demend).
