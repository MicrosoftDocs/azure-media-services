> [!IMPORTANT]
> As Microsoftâ€™s [Responsible AI Standards](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/) outlines, Microsoft is committed to fairness, privacy, security, and transparency with respect to AI systems. To align with these standards, **Azure Media Services is retiring the [Video Analyzer preset](../analyze-video-audio-files-concept.md) on September 14, 2023**. This preset currently allows you to extract multiple video and audio insights from a video file. Customers can replace their current workflows using the more advanced feature set offered by [Azure Video Indexer](/azure/azure-video-indexer/concepts-overview).
