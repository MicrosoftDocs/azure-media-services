title: Encoding seems to be too slow

<!-- 2112020040001414 -->

## Encoding seems to be too slow.

### Cause

1. Encoding may be complex.
1. There may be a lot of output layers.

### Solution

1. Configure the encoder settings to control the balance between speed and quality. For faster encoding, set it to *speed* mode.
1. Reduce the number of output layers.
