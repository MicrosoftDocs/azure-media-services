### Add a storage account to a Media Services account with the portal

Before you add a storage account to a Media Services account, if the storage account doesn't already exist, [create a new storage account](storage-create-how-to.md).

>[!NOTE]
> If you just created a storage account, it will take a few minutes before it shows up in the list of storage accounts.


1. Navigate to the media services account you want to work with.
1. Select **Storage accounts** from the menu.
1. Select Select **+ Storage account**. The choose storage account screen will appear.
1. Select the storage account you want to add to your Media Services account from the list. The storage account will appear on under Storage accounts.
    >[!WARNING]
    > If you created a storage account in a different location (region) from your Media Services account, it will not show up in the list.  Media Services accounts and storage accounts must be in the same region.
1. Select **Save**.
