# Live Event types comparison

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

In Azure Media Services, a  [Live Event](/rest/api/media/liveevents) can be set to either a *pass-through* (an on-premises live encoder sends a multiple bitrate stream) or *live encoding* (an on-premises live encoder sends a single bitrate stream). 

This articles compares features of the live event types.

## Types comparison 

The following table compares features of the Live Event types. The types are set during creation using [LiveEventEncodingType](/rest/api/media/liveevents/create#liveeventencodingtype):

* **LiveEventEncodingType.PassthroughBasic**: An on-premises live encoder sends a multiple bitrate stream. The basic pass-through is limited to a peak ingress of 5Mbps, up to 8-hour DVR window, and live transcription is not supported.
* **LiveEventEncodingType.PassthroughStandard**: An on-premises live encoder sends a multiple bitrate stream. The standard pass-through has higher ingest limits, up to 25-hour DVR window, and support for live transcriptions.
* **LiveEventEncodingType.Standard** - An on-premises live encoder sends a single bitrate stream to the Live Event and Media Services creates multiple bitrate streams. If the contribution feed is of 720p or higher resolution, the **Default720p** preset will encode a set of 6 resolution/bitrate pairs (details follow later in the article).
* **LiveEventEncodingType.Premium1080p** - An on-premises live encoder sends a single bitrate stream to the Live Event and Media Services creates multiple bitrate streams. The Default1080p preset specifies the output set of resolution/bitrate pairs (details follow later in the article).

## System presets

The resolutions and bitrates contained in the output from the live encoder are determined by the [presetName](/rest/api/media/liveevents/create#liveeventencoding). If using a **Standard** live encoder (LiveEventEncodingType.Standard), then the *Default720p* preset specifies a set of 6 resolution/bitrate pairs described below. Otherwise, if using a **Premium1080p** live encoder (LiveEventEncodingType.Premium1080p), then the *Default1080p* preset specifies the output set of resolution/bitrate pairs.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot apply the Default1080p preset to a Live Event if it has been setup for Standard live encoding - you will get an error. You will also get an error if you try to apply the Default720p preset to a Premium1080p live encoder.

### Output Video Streams for Default720p

If the contribution feed is of 720p or higher resolution, the **Default720p** preset will encode the feed into the following 6 layers. In the table below, Bitrate is in kbps, MaxFPS represents that maximum allowed frame rate (in frames/second), Profile represents the H.264 Profile used.

If the source frame rate on input is >30 fps, the frame rate will be reduced to match half of the input frame rate.  For example 60 fps would be reduced to 30fps.  50 fps would be reduced to 25 fps, etc.


| Bitrate | Width | Height | MaxFPS | Profile |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 3500    | 1280  | 720    | 30     | High    |
| 2200    | 960   | 540    | 30     | High    |
| 1350    | 704   | 396    | 30     | High    |
| 850     | 512   | 288    | 30     | High    |
| 550     | 384   | 216    | 30     | High    |
| 200     | 340   | 192    | 30     | High    |

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to customize the live encoding preset, please open a support ticket via Azure Portal. You should specify the desired table of video resolution and bitrates. Customization of the audio encoding bitrate is not supported. Do verify that there is only one layer at 720p, and at most 6 layers. Also do specify that you are requesting a preset.

### Output Video Streams for Default1080p

If the contribution feed is of 1080p resolution, the **Default1080p** preset will encode the feed into the following 6 layers.

If the source frame rate on input is >30 fps, the frame rate will be reduced to match half of the input frame rate.  For example 60 fps would be reduced to 30fps.  50 fps would be reduced to 25 fps, etc.

| Bitrate | Width | Height | MaxFPS | Profile |
| ------- | ----- | ------ | ------ | ------- |
| 5500    | 1920  | 1080   | 30     | High    |
| 3000    | 1280  | 720    | 30     | High    |
| 1600    | 960   | 540    | 30     | High    |
| 800     | 640   | 360    | 30     | High    |
| 400     | 480   | 270    | 30     | High    |
| 200     | 320   | 180    | 30     | High    |

> [!NOTE]
> If you need to customize the live encoding preset, please open a support ticket via Azure Portal. You should specify the desired table of resolution and bitrates. Verify that there is only one layer at 1080p, and at most 6 layers. Also, specify that you are requesting a preset for a Premium1080p live encoder. The specific values of the bitrates and resolutions may be adjusted over time.

### Output Audio Stream for Default720p and Default1080p

For both *Default720p* and *Default1080p* presets, audio is encoded to stereo AAC-LC at 128 kbps. The sampling rate follows that of the audio track in the contribution feed.

> [!NOTE]
> If the sampling rate is low, such as 8khz, the encoded output will be lower than 128kbps.

## Implicit properties of the live encoder

The previous section describes the properties of the live encoder that can be controlled explicitly, via the preset - such as the number of layers, resolutions, and bitrates. This section clarifies the implicit properties.

### Group of pictures (GOP) duration

The live encoder follows the [GOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_pictures) structure of the contribution feed - which means the output layers will have the same GOP duration. Hence, it is recommended that you configure the on-premises encoder to produce a contribution feed that has fixed GOP duration (typically 2 seconds). This will ensure that the outgoing HLS and MPEG DASH streams from the service also has fixed GOP durations. Small variations in GOP durations are likely to be tolerated by most devices.

### Frame rate limits

The live encoder also follows the durations of the individual video frames in the contribution feed - which means the output layers will have frames with the same durations. Hence, it is recommended that you configure the on-premises encoder to produce a contribution feed that has fixed frame rate (at most 30 frames/second). This will ensure that the outgoing HLS and MPEG DASH streams from the service also has fixed frame rates durations. Small variations in frame rates may be tolerated by most devices, but there is no guarantee that the live encoder will produce an output that will play correctly. Your on-premises live encoder should not be dropping frames (eg. under low battery conditions) or varying the frame rate in any way.

If the source frame rate on input is >30 fps, the frame rate will be reduced to match half of the input frame rate.  For example 60 fps would be reduced to 30fps.  50 fps would be reduced to 25 fps, etc.

### Resolution of contribution feed and output layers

The live encoder is configured to avoid up-converting the contribution feed. As a result the maximum resolution of the output layers will not exceed that of the contribution feed.

For example, if you send a contribution feed at 720p to a Live Event configured for Default1080p live encoding, the output will only have 5 layers, starting with 720p at 3Mbps, going down to 1080p at 200 kbps. Or if you send a contribution feed at 360p into a Live Event configured for Standard live encoding, the output will contain 3 layers (at resolutions of 288p, 216p, and 192p). In the degenerate case, if you send a contribution feed of, say, 160x90 pixels to a Standard live encoder, the output will contain one layer at 160x90 resolution at the same bitrate as that of the contribution feed.

### Bitrate of contribution feed and output layers

The live encoder is configured to honor the bitrate settings in the preset, irrespective of the bitrate of the contribution feed. As a result the bitrate of the output layers may exceed that of the contribution feed. For example, if you send in a contribution feed at a resolution of 720p at 1 Mbps, the output layers will remain the same as in the [table](live-event-types-comparison-reference.md#output-video-streams-for-default720p) above.
