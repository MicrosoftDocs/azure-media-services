This article is a listing of code samples for Analytics.
## Use basic Audio Analytics with per-job language override
This sample illustrates how to create a audio analyzer transform using the basic mode. It also shows how you can override the preset language on a per-job basis to avoid creating a transform for every language. It also shows how to upload a media file to an input asset, submit a job with the transform and download the results for verification.
