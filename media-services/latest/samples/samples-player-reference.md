This article is a listing of code samples for Player.

## Use Shaka player with Timed Metadata for live event interactivity

This sample shows how to use the Google Shaka player with Low latency HLS streams to receive timed metadata events and display an interactive information overlay on the video element. This can be used to build interactive ads, quiz shows, polling, and other solutions that require events to be triggered in your web page or application during a live stream.
