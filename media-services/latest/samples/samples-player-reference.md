# Azure Media Services Player code samples

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](../includes/v3-hr.md)]

This article is a listing of code samples for Player.

## Use Shaka player with Timed Metadata for live event interactivity

This sample shows how to use the Google Shaka player with Low latency HLS streams to receive timed metadata events and display an interactive information overlay on the video element. This can be used to build interactive ads, quiz shows, polling, and other solutions that require events to be triggered in your web page or application during a live stream.

## Use HLS.js and timed-metadata insertion

This sample demonstrates how to use the HLS.js player with HLS low latency live streaming (LL-HLS) and timed metadata insertion. Azure Media Services supports playback in any Javascript Media Source Extension based player that can support the streaming of HLS, Low latency HLS (LL-HLS) and MPEG DASH formats. The HLS.js player is an open source player solution that works well with AMS streaming.
