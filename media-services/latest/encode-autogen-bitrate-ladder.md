#  Encode with an auto-generated bitrate ladder

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

## Overview

This article explains how to use the Standard Encoder in Media Services to encode an input video into an auto-generated bitrate ladder (bitrate-resolution pairs) based on the input resolution and bitrate. This built-in encoder setting, or preset, will never exceed the input resolution and bitrate. For example, if the input is 720p at 3 Mbps, output remains 720p at best, and will start at rates lower than 3 Mbps.

### Encoding for streaming

When you use the **AdaptiveStreaming** or **H265AdaptiveStreaming** preset in **Transform**, you get an output that is suitable for delivery via streaming protocols like HLS and DASH. When using one of these two presets, the service intelligently determines how many video layers to generate and at what bitrate and resolution. The output content contains MP4 files where AAC-encoded audio and either H.264-encoded video (in the case of the AdaptiveStreaming preset) or H.265/HEVC (in the case of the H265AdaptiveStreaming preset). The output MP4 files are non-interleaved.

To see an example of how this preset is used, see [Stream a file](stream-files-dotnet-quickstart.md).

## Output

This section shows three examples of the output video layers produced by the Media Services encoder as a result of encoding with the **AdaptiveStreaming**(H.264) or the **H265AdaptiveStreaming** (HEVC) presets. In all cases, the output contains an audio-only MP4 file with stereo audio encoded at 128 kbps.

### Example 1
Source with height "1080" and framerate "29.970" produces 6 video layers:

|Layer|Height|Width|Bitrate (kbps)|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|1080|1920|6780|
|2|720|1280|3520|
|3|540|960|2210|
|4|360|640|1150|
|5|270|480|720|
|6|180|320|380|

### Example 2
Source with height "720" and framerate "23.970" produces 5 video layers:

|Layer|Height|Width|Bitrate (kbps)|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|720|1280|2940|
|2|540|960|1850|
|3|360|640|960|
|4|270|480|600|
|5|180|320|320|

### Example 3
Source with height "360" and framerate "29.970" produces 3 video layers:

|Layer|Height|Width|Bitrate (kbps)|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|360|640|700|
|2|270|480|440|
|3|180|320|230|


## Content-aware encoding comparison

The [content-aware encoding presets](./encode-content-aware-concept.md) offer a better solution over the adaptive streaming presets by analyzing the source content prior to deciding the right set of output bitrates and resolutions to use in the ladder.
It's recommended to test out the [content-aware encoding presets](./encode-content-aware-concept.md) first before using the more static and fixed ladder provided by the adaptive bitrate streaming presets.
