# Azure Media Services v3 overview

[!INCLUDE [media services api v3 logo](./includes/v3-hr.md)]

Azure Media Services is a cloud-based platform that enables you to build solutions that achieve broadcast-quality video streaming, enhance accessibility and distribution, analyze content, and much more. Whether you're an app developer, a call center, a government agency, or an entertainment company, Media Services helps you create apps that deliver media experiences of outstanding quality to large audiences on today's most popular mobile devices and browsers.

## What can I do with Media Services?

Media Services lets you build a variety of media workflows in the cloud. Some examples of what you can do with Media Services include:

* Deliver videos in various formats so they can be played on a wide variety of browsers and devices. For both on-demand and live streaming delivery to various clients (mobile devices, TV, PC, and so on), the video and audio content needs to be encoded and packaged appropriately.
* Stream live sporting events to a large audience, like soccer, baseball, college and high school sports, and more.
* Broadcast public meetings and events, like town halls, city council meetings, and legislative bodies.
* Analyze recorded videos or audio content. For example, to achieve higher customer satisfaction, organizations can extract speech-to-text and build search indexes and dashboards. Then, they can extract intelligence around common complaints, sources of complaints, and other relevant data.
* Create a subscription video service and stream DRM protected content when a customer (for example, a movie studio) needs to restrict the access and use of proprietary copyrighted work.
* Deliver offline content for playback on airplanes, trains, and automobiles. A customer might need to download content onto their phone or tablet for playback when they anticipate to be disconnected from the network.
* Enable Azure CDN to achieve large scaling to better handle instantaneous high loads (for example, the start of a product launch event).
